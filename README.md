# Tools

In this dictionary, you'll find several tools written by **C Language** to convert file types.

For this version of Tools, it is only supported by the conversion between python file (*\*.py*) and ipython file (*\*.ipynb*).

As we all known, there are two file types of python. Sometimes, we use *\*.ipynb*, and maybe some other day, we need to use *\*.py*. To convert in these two file types quickly can save us much time.

And for the security, I choose the **C Language** which will make a binary file after compilation.

## Environment

Linux Operation System

I used some commands in Linux, such as **sed**, so it's now available on Linux, or maybe MacOS (I haven't any Virtual Machine of MacOS yet, so I'm not sure)

## Usage

./[tool name] \[Option\] \[the file path you need to convert\]

And you get a new file converted at the same path of the converting file.
